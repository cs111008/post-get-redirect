# post-get-redirect
 POST - GET - REDIRECT Pattern using express and Node JS
 
 I have Implemented two solutions for this pattern.
 
 1. Using ``express-flash`` module
 2. By creating custom middleware to add flash messages using express session.



EDIT - src/server/server.js

 Currently solution - 1 is activated by default.
 
 For soultion-2,  Please uncomment solution 2 (line:52 - 58) and comment solution 1 (line:42 - 43)
